Questions for Assessment:
1. Data Sources & Types:
What types of data will the system need to handle (e.g., user information, KYC data, transaction records, product details)?
Are there any specific external data sources or third-party APIs that need to be integrated (e.g., KYC verification, financial data services)?
How frequently will data from external sources be updated, and are there any dependencies that must be considered?
2. Current Infrastructure:
What existing infrastructure (e.g., cloud, on-premise servers) is being used to host current applications?
Are there existing databases, servers, or other components that this new system needs to integrate with or replace?
Is there a preference for cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), and what current services, if any, are already used?
3. Integration Points:
What are the required integration points (e.g., CRM systems, financial services, SMS providers for OTP)?
Are there any existing services or APIs that must be maintained or modified for compatibility with the new system?
Will there be data-sharing requirements with other internal or external systems for reporting or operational purposes?
4. Performance & Scalability:
What are the expected load levels for the system in terms of users, transactions, or data volume?
Are there anticipated peak times (e.g., during trading hours or major events) when the system should be able to handle additional load?
Should the system support both vertical and horizontal scaling to accommodate future growth?
5. Security & Compliance:
What compliance regulations need to be adhered to (e.g., GDPR, financial industry standards)?
Are there specific security protocols required for user data (e.g., encryption, access control, multi-factor authentication)?
What kind of audit trail or logging is required for compliance and security auditing purposes?
6. Data Management:
What data retention policies need to be implemented for KYC and transactional data?
Should certain data be archived or deleted after a set period to ensure compliance or reduce storage costs?
How critical is the need for real-time data access versus eventual consistency for non-critical data?
7. Tools & Technology:
Are there preferred programming languages, frameworks, or platforms for development (e.g., Java, Python, React)?
Are there any specific DevOps tools or CI/CD processes already in use that should be integrated?
Should the technology stack be selected based on compatibility with existing systems, cost-effectiveness, or team familiarity?
8. Downstream Usage:
Who are the downstream users of the data (e.g., internal teams, external partners), and how will they use it?
Are there any specific reporting requirements that downstream users need to fulfill?
What kind of data formats are required for downstream systems (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV)?
Concerns to Address:
1. Data Volume & Complexity:
What is the estimated volume of data that the system will need to handle in the short-term and long-term?
Will the system need to process complex datasets (e.g., historical financial data, investor risk profiles), and how should that be managed?
2. Data Transformation:
Are there specific data transformations required for reports, analytics, or integration with other systems?
Will data transformations be handled in real-time or batched for offline processing?
3. Latency and Throughput:
What is the acceptable level of latency for different types of operations (e.g., investor transactions, KYC processing)?
How should the system handle large volumes of requests without degradation of service?
4. Compatibility:
Does the new system need to be compatible with older systems or interfaces already in use by stakeholders?
Should the system be accessible across multiple platforms (e.g., web, mobile) with a consistent user experience?
5. Data Storage:
What are the storage requirements in terms of data type (structured, unstructured) and expected volume?
Is there a preference for specific storage solutions (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL, cloud storage services)?
6. Compliance and Security:
What personal or sensitive data needs to be protected, and how will this be secured both at rest and in transit?
Are there regular compliance audits that the system must accommodate, and what reporting capabilities are needed for this?
